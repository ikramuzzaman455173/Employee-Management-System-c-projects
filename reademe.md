Here's a detailed overview of the project, documenting each aspect of the Employee Management System:

---

### **Employee Management System**

#### **Purpose**
This project provides a simple Employee Management System that:
- Allows users to manage employee details.
- Marks attendance for employees.
- Searches, updates, and deletes employee records.
- Ensures data persistence using file operations.

#### **Features**
1. **Add Employee**
   - Adds a new employee to the system.
   - Saves employee data (ID, Name, Salary) to a file.

2. **Display All Employees**
   - Displays all employee records, including attendance status.

3. **Mark Attendance**
   - Marks an employee as present using their ID.

4. **Search Employee**
   - Searches for an employee by ID and displays their details.

5. **Update Employee Details**
   - Updates an existing employee's name and salary.

6. **Delete Employee**
   - Deletes an employee record using their ID.

7. **Persistent Storage**
   - All employee data is stored in a binary file (`employees.dat`), ensuring data is not lost when the program is closed.

8. **Error Handling**
   - Handles errors such as invalid inputs and non-existent employee IDs.

#### **File Organization**
- **Header File:**
  All function prototypes and structure definitions are defined at the beginning of the file.
- **Main File:**
  Contains the main logic and menu-driven system to perform operations.

#### **Code Breakdown**
1. **Structure Definition**
   - The `Employee` structure holds details about each employee:
     ```c
     struct Employee {
         int id;
         char name[50];
         double salary;
         int attendance; // 1 for present, 0 for absent
     };
     ```

2. **File Operations**
   - **Save to File:** Saves all employees to a binary file.
   - **Load from File:** Loads employee data from the file.

3. **Menu Options**
   - **Add Employee:** Reads employee details and appends to the list.
   - **Display All Employees:** Iterates through the list and displays details.
   - **Mark Attendance:** Updates the attendance status for a specific employee.
   - **Search Employee:** Finds and displays details of an employee by ID.
   - **Update Employee Details:** Modifies existing employee details.
   - **Delete Employee:** Removes an employee from the list.

4. **Main Function**
   - A menu-driven system allows the user to choose operations:
     ```c
     while (1) {
         printf("1. Add Employee\\n2. Display All Employees\\n3. Mark Attendance\\n");
         printf("4. Search Employee\\n5. Update Employee\\n6. Delete Employee\\n7. Exit\\n");
         scanf("%d", &choice);
         // Perform operations based on user choice
     }
     ```

#### **How to Use**
1. **Compile the Program And Run the Program **
   Use a C compiler such as `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc update-employee-management-system.c -o update-employee-management-system && ./update-employee-management-system
   ```

2. **Menu Options**
   Follow the menu options to perform various tasks:
   - Add employee details.
   - View all employees.
   - Mark attendance and manage employee records.

---

#### **Simplifications**
- All functions are self-contained, handling specific tasks like adding or deleting employees.
- Uses file I/O for data persistence, making it beginner-friendly.
